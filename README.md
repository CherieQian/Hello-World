     Hi!Today I registered the GitHub.Maybe I like coding,maybe not.But I want to change the situation at present.
These days,I am not happy because I waste most of time watching  soup opera.I didn't control myself ,I am just absorsed  in it.I hata the time of no targets.So I must find a new target ,I can deal with the aim with the free time.
